This was a attempt to pitch a different Official TC Tele NPC ai in reference to
https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCoreCustomChanges/issues/2

However another open source AI exsisted that was already pulled and been using.
TC preferred the current one to be maintained and updated instead of moving to
a whole new AI script. This sits parked for anyone to use.
