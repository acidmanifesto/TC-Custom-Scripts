This was a attempt to address issue 13 for a equipment exchange npc
https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCoreCustomChanges/issues/13

It was based on a very beginner developer's script. the developers script had a great idea, but very poor execution and script.
I rewrote the script but as of right now, there is a issue with moving or unequiping exsisting gear, so the gear gets completely
removed. Level 80 character is required, configurable cost per conf.
Until we can solve the issue of the unequiping not happening. This issue will sit in limbo.

Script is deemed unofficial and unfinished until further development.
