This is a somewhat sucessful or failure of a script.
It all depends if it suits your needs.

This added a schedule daily restart to the world server based on a 24 hour time clock.
The issue? you need to start the world server with a custom external script that is provided.
Windows-Restarter.bat for windows
Linux-Restarter.sh for linux

If you dont mind using the external scripts to start the world server then this patch is for you.
If you do mind it, then this script is a failure.
